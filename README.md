# `VigramSDK`

VigramSDK is a library to connect your app to viDoc to retrieve location data and perform laser distance recordings.

For more information, you can view the documentation using [this]([https://vigram-gmbh.github.io/SDK_Android_viDoc_Distribution/](https://vigram-sw.github.io/SDK_Android_viDoc_Distribution/))

## Installation

<b> Step 1. </b> Add the token to \$HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties

```
authToken= 'jp_pn65lpuuc9hmdvoj7b7egl63r4'
```

<b> Step 2. </b> Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
 allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven {
            url "https://jitpack.io"
            credentials { username authToken }
        }
    }
 }
```

### General

How to create services, change the configuration.


- Use the ``Vigram`` sealed class to create various services, such as a ``BluetoothService``, a ``NtripService``, a ``GPSService`` or a ``LaserService``:
```kotlin
fun init(context: Context, token: String): Authentication

fun bluetoothService(activity: Activity, context: Context): BluetoothService

fun peripheral(peripheral: BluetoothDevice): Peripheral

fun peripheral(peripheral: BluetoothDevice, peripheralLogger: PeripheralLogger): Peripheral

fun peripheral(peripheral: BluetoothDevice, peripheralConfiguration: PeripheralConfiguration): Peripheral

fun peripheral(peripheral: BluetoothDevice, peripheralLogger: PeripheralLogger, peripheralConfiguration: PeripheralConfiguration): Peripheral

fun ntripService(): NtripService

fun laserService(peripheral: Peripheral): LaserService

fun gpsService(peripheral: Peripheral,ntripTask: NtripTask): GPSService

fun singlePointRecordingService(gpsService: GPSService): SinglePointRecordingService

fun singlePointRecordingService(gpsService: GPSService, constantHeight: Int): SinglePointRecordingService

fun singlePointRecordingService(gpsService: GPSService, laserService: LaserService, laserConfiguration: LaserConfiguration): SinglePointRecordingService

fun singlePointRecordingService(gpsService: GPSService, constantHeight: Int, dynamicStateType: DynamicStateType): SinglePointRecordingService

fun singlePointRecordingService(gpsService: GPSService, laserService: LaserService, laserConfiguration: LaserConfiguration, dynamicStateType: DynamicStateType): SinglePointRecordingService

fun tokenIsValid(): AuthenticationData

fun peripheralLogger(uri: Uri): PeripheralLogger
```
Note: First of all, create ``Authentication`` using the ``init`` method, and then apply the ``check`` method of the ``Authentication`` class to verify the token.

- To get all available versions by ``SoftwareService`` of the software, use the ``getAllAvailableSoftware`` method.

- ``Configuration`` allows the configuration and customization of several VigramSDK components.

- ``BluetoothService``  provides methods to interact with the device at the lower level.

- ``Peripheral`` provides a write and receive interface to communicate with the viDoc device.
### Messages

The messages received from viDoc and related model types.

- ``DeviceMessage``contains messages sent from the viDoc itself.

- ``NMEAMessage`` is an interface containing common properties for NMEA messages (for GGA, GGA, GNS, GST messages)
- ``GGAMessage`` is used for location data and correction information.

- ``GNSMessage`` is used for GNSS fix data.

- ``GSTMessage`` is used for accuracy information.


- ``GSAMessage`` is used for DOP and active satellites information.

- ``Mode`` is a GNSMessage's Mode indicator.

- ``SatelliteMessage`` contains messages about satellite (ublox config, such as ``Dop``, ``Pvt``, ``AcknowledgeMessage``, ``Elevation``, ``NavigationSystemStatus``, ``RAWX``, ``SFRBX``, ``DynamicStateType``, ``RateValue``) sent from the viDoc itself.


- ``DMMCoordinate`` contains the coordinate encoding format used in several NMEA-0183 messages.


- ``Time`` as specified in a NMEA-0183 message.




### Ntrip Connection

How to discover and connect to Ntrip mountpoints.
- ``NtripConnectionInformation`` combines all connection data needed to connect to an NTRIP server besides the necessary mountpoint.

- ``NtripService`` is used to search for NTRIP mountpoints for various NTRIP providers and create ``NtripTask`` instances to access NTRIP data.

- ``NtripMountPoint`` is a NTRIP mountpoint to get RTK information from.

- ``NtripTask`` requests RTK data over a NTRIP connection.


### GPS

How to receive coordinate and accuracy data from viDoc.

- ``GPSService`` to observe location data, location quality characteristics and 
accuracy information.
- ``GPSDisconnectSignal`` is sent by a GPSService when a certain event occurs that should lead to the disconnection of a GPSService.
- ``GPSCoordinate`` containing latitude, longitude, referenceAltitude and geoidSeparation.
- ``GPSServiceQuality`` contains the quality of the currently provided location data.
- ``GPSQualityIndicator`` contains the quality indicator of the GPS position as specified in a GGAMessage.

### Laser

How to access and communicate with the laser module in viDoc.

- Use a ``LaserService`` to start laser distance recording sessions with a given configuration
- ``LaserConfiguration`` is a configuration for the laser module of a viDoc peripheral

### Environment

How to read the Android device's surroundings and combine with GPS information.

An ``EnvironmentData`` contains all the available information from the user android device and the viDoc device.


### SinglePoints

How to record single points with increased accuracy.

- ``SinglePoint`` is the result of a single point recording, where a certain position is recorded over a given duration.
- ``SinglePointRecordingService`` can be used to record single points over a given duration. During the recording phase, the service will keep track of all the environment’s data and then merge individual measurements to one combined single point.


### Enumerations
- ``ElevationValue`` contains the values for Filter GNSS Constel lation system currently using in navigation
- ``NavigationSystemType`` сontains enumerations of satellite navigation systems of the GNSS grouping
- ``RateValue`` is used to changing rate of messages value
- ``StateNtrip`` сontains the type of Ntrip connection state log, including connection has been preparing, ready and error in case failure connection.
- ``StateUpdateSoftware`` сontains the type of Software Progress log, including update software has been starting and error in case failure updating software.
